BEHOLD, ehower went forth te sow:

And when he sowed, some seede fell

by the way side, and the fowls eeme and
devoured them up.

Some fell upon stony places, where
they had not mueh earth3 and forthwith
they sprung up, because they hed no
deepness of earth:

And when the sun was up, they were
seorched3 and because they hed no root,
they withered away. ’

And some fell among thorns 3 end the
thorus sprung up, and ehohed them.

But other fell into good ground, end
brought forth fruit, some an hundredfolh
some sixtyfold‚ some thirtyfole

Who hath ears to heer, let him hear.
